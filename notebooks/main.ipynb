    "## **STORE SALES FOR OPTIMAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT USING TIME SERIES FORECASTING**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a robust time series regression model to forecast the sales of thousands of products across different stores of Corporation Favorita, a leading grocery retailer based in Ecuador. Accurate sales predictions are critical for ensuring the right quantity of products is always in stock, thereby minimizing stockouts and overstock situations.\n",
    "Using the CRISP-DM framework, this project involves comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the application of advanced machine learning models. The training dataset includes historical sales data, store and product information, promotions, transactions, oil prices, and holiday events. By leveraging this rich dataset, the project will address key analytical questions, validate hypotheses, and ultimately build a predictive model to enhance inventory management.\n",
    "The final model will be evaluated on its ability to accurately predict sales, with the goal of achieving an RMSLE of 0.2 or better. Insights from the analysis will inform strategic decisions in marketing, promotions, and supply chain operations, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction at Corporation Favorita. Comprehensive documentation will ensure transparency and reproducibility of the project.\n",

    "#### **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "To forecast the demand of products in various locations to ensure that Corporation Favorita always has the right quantity of products in stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a series of machine learning models to predict unit sales for thousands of items across different Favorita stores.\n",
    "I will use the provided data to make accurate sales predictions for better inventory management.\n",

    "\n",
    "7.\tWhat analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?\n",
